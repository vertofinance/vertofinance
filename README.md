👋 Hi, I'm Eric Emil Luyangi!

🎯 Passionate about Financial Inclusion & AI-Driven Innovation

With over a decade of experience in microfinance across East Africa, I’m on a mission to empower communities through accessible financial services. I’m not a traditional coder, but I’m vibe-coding my way through building a Regional Microfinance Marketplace Platform that leverages AI and machine learning to transform how Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) operate.
I’m thrilled by AI’s potential to revolutionize coding and financial systems, making technology more inclusive and impactful. These are exciting times, and I’m learning, building, and innovating one step at a time!

🚀 What I’m Working On

🔧 Building: A cloud-based microfinance platform tailored for East African MFIs, integrating AI to streamline lending, compliance, and customer engagement.
🧠 Tech Stack Focus: Microservices architecture, AI/ML integration, multi-tenant platforms, and interoperability with systems like NIDA, BRELA, TRA, and TIPS.
🤝 Goal: Create a scalable, smart marketplace to empower a thriving MFI ecosystem.

💡 About Me

Background: 10+ years in microfinance and financial inclusion, now diving into tech to solve real-world problems.
Vibe-Coding Journey: No formal coding experience, but I’m passionate about learning and using AI tools to build solutions. If I can explain my ideas to my 11-year-old son and he gets it, I know I’m on the right track!
Fun Fact: I love breaking down complex problems into simple solutions, often testing them through conversations with my son.
